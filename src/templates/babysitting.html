<br/>
Hello! My name is Jenna and I have been babysitting children of all ages for over 9 years.  I am originally from Minnesota, completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Arizona, and moved to Manhattan last year to pursue my M.S. degree in Nutritional Sciences at Columbia University.  I am currently working on my thesis at the NYC Department of Health and hope to pursue a career in the public health field.  Throughout high school and college, I worked with children in multiple settings including a muscular dystrophy camp, child care center, church, individual families, and an after school program where I taught elementary school children about nutrition and physical activity.  Outside of work, I love to cook, play piano, travel, and run throughout the city.  I am very enthusiastic, personable, and reliable and I look forward to working with you and your family!
